#Final Assignment
This assignment is the implementation of a shell simulator that is very similar to the shell in Unix/Unix-like systems. The shell uses the MTX Operating System syscalls developed by KC Wang (professor of this class). Also included in this assignment are the implementation of the following programs:

* l2u - Converts contents of a file to uppercase characters
* login - Credential checking for user-login system
* grep - Prints all lines found in specified file
* more - Displays contents of a file (or from stdin) on a line-by-line basis
* cat - Displays all contents of a file (or stdin) in bulk
* sh - The shell program which utilizes MTX syscalls to run programs
* init - Initializes the operating system

Also included are other files which contain helper functions for user-mode programs to be run (e.g. ucode.c).
